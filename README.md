# 🛒 Customer Purchase Value Prediction  

This repository contains my Kaggle notebook, where I build and analyze a machine learning model to **predict customer purchase value** based on multiple user sessions and interactions across digital touchpoints.  

## 📖 Project Overview  
- 📊 **Dataset**: Multi-session customer behavior data from Kaggle  
- 🤖 **Goal**: Predict purchase value of customers  
- ⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- 📈 **Approach**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation  

## 🚀 Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visual insights  
- Session-level behavior transformation into user-level features  
- Multiple ML models tested and compared  
- Prediction of customer purchase value
